# Major-Project-heart-disease
Exploring the workflow of a Random Forest Classifier utilized in classifying heart disease.
Understand the Random Forest algorithm's intuition, advantages, and
disadvantages. Learn about feature selection using Random Forests
and the difference between Random Forests and Decision Trees.
Explore the relationship between Random Forests and nearest
neighbors, import necessary libraries and datasets, conduct
exploratory data analysis, perform feature engineering, and build
Random Forest Classifier models with default and tuned parameters.
Evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and classification
report, visualize important features, and draw conclusions based on
the results.
